INTRODUCTION

This is an AI program with a medium level of intelligence. At this point, you must explicitly teach it everything. In this new version, the WING update, it has a user-defined
chance to guess what you wanted to tell it and respond. The program has a special feature called Crunch Commands that allow you to do a whole heap of things,
from math to simulations to even executing shell commands. The latest version, nai, makes it more enjoyable to program by hand and to use in project such as IRC bots.

INSTALLATION
The Debian package is the best way of installing this software. There are other ways, though. The executable is ready to roll; all you need to do is invoke it from the command line.
You can also compile the source to create an executable, but that would create extra work for minimal gain.

LICENSE
This newest version of nAI is licensed under the GNU General Public License where before it was licensed under my custom Noran Restricted Public License v2.0, but there were too many
legal gaps.

NAMING
Mature version numbers will bring a tier identifier; a codename for that particular version.
The name is based on a major feature at that revision. For example, WING was the name given to all versions of AI 1, since I added a WING feature to Engine.h in that version.

nai will always be the name of the executable despite the earlier name "Wing" and the next version being called "mantic".

VERSION
mantic - 4.0: Added true learning capabilities and a bunch of settings, in addition to making it 200 times more efficient than before.

FUTURE PLANS
In future versions of semantic: Add function cleanFile() so the learn file can optimize itself for size. I will also make this GNU-standards compliant. I also want to add 
the "am" keyword to the semantic parsing as well as adding a bunch more options and
possibly a configuration file. 4.0 will be the biggest age of development for nai
yet.

MAP
This software comes with a lot of files. Here is a list of what each do.

main.cpp - Main file
bin/Release/nai - Executable file

HEADER/aiCore.h - Utilities relating directly to the talking and learning part of the program.
HEADER/Crunch/crunch.h - Top-level abstractions for crunchLand
HEADER/Crunch/crunchLand.h - Lowest level. Returns the functions relating to crunches.
HEADER/Crunch/voids.h - No-mans-land, basically. Holds big things for crunchLand.


CHANGELOG
WING - 1: Added the "wing" feature, where the program will try to guess what you wanted to tell it.
WING - 1.1: Updated the "wing" feature to be more accurate, added a default input.txt and output.txt, and added gravebang comments.
WING - 1.2: Updated the "wing" feature again and fixed gravebang issues.
WING - 1.5: Removed all gotos and added an interface to LibMath.h
WING - 1.5.1: Added a new kind of sentence to rand, documentation, and formatted.
WING - 1.6: Added another type of WING response and fixed
WING - 1.6.1: Fixed a serious issue in the second WING response.
WING - Semantic(1.6-2.0): Undocumented update. Tested some lexical stuff.

nAI - (3.0): Complete rewrite of WING.
nAI - (3.5): Why the big jump in the version number? I added a lot to aiCore.h. Now people can wire the learning file themselves with comments and multichars.

mantic - (4.0): Added semantic parses, made more efficient.
