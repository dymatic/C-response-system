INTRODUCTION

This is an AI program with a medium level of intelligence. At this point, you must explicitly teach it everything. In this new version, the WING update, it has a user-defined chance to guess what you wanted to tell it and respond. The program has a special feature called Crunch Commands that allow you to do a whole heap of things, from math to simulations.

INSTALLATION
The Debian package is the best way of installing this software. There are other ways, though. The executable is ready to roll; all you need to do is invoke it from the command line.You have to make sure that it is in its own directory so that Input.txt and Output.txt do not clutter up the directory where you extract it. You can also compile the source to create an executable, but that would create extra work for minimal gain.

LICENSE

NAMING
Mature version numbers will bring a tier identifier, a codename for that particular version. The name is based on a major feature at that revision. For example, WING was the name given to all versions of AI 1, since I added a WING feature to Engine.h in that version.

VERSION
nAI - 3.5: Added functionallity to the learn file. Now it's fun to program yourself!

FUTURE PLANS
EVEN more stuff coming to the learn file in 3.6. 3.5 was just a small preview. I will be re-adding comments with SCT's splistr() implementation.
Also, since the program is designed to be "smart", I am going to add something that detects multiple output and groups it together itself.

MAP
This software comes with a lot of files. Here is a list of what each do.

main.cpp - Main file
bin/Release/nai - Executable file

HEADER/aiCore.h - Utilities relating directly to the talking and learning part of the program.
HEADER/Crunch/crunch.h - Top-level abstractions for crunchLand
HEADER/Crunch/crunchLand.h - Lowest level. Returns the functions relating to crunches.
HEADER/Crunch/voids.h - No-mans-land, basically. Holds big things for crunchLand.


CHANGELOG
WING - 1: Added the "wing" feature, where the program will try to guess what you wanted to tell it.
WING - 1.1: Updated the "wing" feature to be more accurate, added a default input.txt and output.txt, and added gravebang comments.
WING - 1.2: Updated the "wing" feature again and fixed gravebang issues.
WING - 1.5: Removed all gotos and added an interface to LibMath.h
WING - 1.5.1: Added a new kind of sentence to rand, documentation, and formatted.
WING - 1.6: Added another type of WING response and fixed 
WING - 1.6.1: Fixed a serious issue in the second WING response.
WING - Semantic(1.6-2.0): Undocumented update. Tested some lexical stuff.

nAI - (3.0): Complete rewrite of WING.
nAI - (3.5): Why the big jump in the version number? I added a lot to aiCore.h. Now people can wire the learning file themselves.
