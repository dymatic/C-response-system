INTRODUCTION

This is an AI program with a medium level of intelligence. At this point, you must explicitly teach it everything. In this new version, the WING update, it has a user-defined
chance to guess what you wanted to tell it and respond. The program has a special feature called Crunch Commands that allow you to do a whole heap of things,
from math to simulations to even executing shell commands. The latest version, nai, makes it more enjoyable to program by hand and to use in project such as IRC bots.
Utilities for IRC bot creators are included, such as a configuration file to prevent abuse.

INSTALLATION
The Debian package is the best way of installing this software. There are other ways, though. The executable is ready to roll; all you need to do is invoke it from the command line.
You can also compile the source to create an executable, but that would create extra work for minimal gain.

RUNNING
You can run the executable in two ways. Interactive mode occurs when you load a configuration file or do not supply arguments. Arg mode runs when you supply two arguments. In the future
command-line options will replace the old way of invoking the program in arg mode, and once it is safer that way will return.

LICENSE
This newest version of nAI is licensed under the GNU General Public License where before it was licensed under my custom Noran Restricted Public License v2.0, but there were too many
legal gaps.

NAMING
Mature version numbers will bring a tier identifier; a codename for that particular version.
The name is based on a major feature at that revision. For example, WING was the name given to all versions of AI 1, since I added a WING feature to Engine.h in that version.

nai will always be the name of the executable despite the earlier name "AI" and the next version being called "mantic".

VERSION
mantic - 4.5: Big commit. Configuration files and main migration as well as structures for command line options.

FUTURE PLANS
In future versions of semantic: Add function cleanFile() so the learn file can optimize itself for size. I also want to add 
the "am" keyword to the semantic parsing as well as adding a bunch more options.

In the next release of nAI the source will be cleaned a LOT and crunchLand.h will be re-imagined.
4.x will be the biggest age of development for nai
yet.

MAP
This software comes with a lot of files. Here is a list of what each do.

main.cpp - Main file
bin/Release/nai - Executable file

HEADER/aiCore.h - Utilities relating directly to the talking and learning part of the program.
HEADER/mainHelper.h - Utilities used for command line options and startup.

HEADER/Crunch/crunch.h - Top-level abstractions for crunchLand
HEADER/Crunch/crunchLand.h - Lowest level. Returns the functions relating to crunches.
HEADER/Crunch/voids.h - No-mans-land, basically. Holds big things for crunchLand and GNU commands.


res/* - Non-critical files that stand as an example
crit/* - After 4.5 these will hold critical files such as the configuration file.

DEBIAN/* - Used for creating the Debian installation file file.

CHANGELOG
WING - 1: Added the "wing" feature, where the program will try to guess what you wanted to tell it.
WING - 1.1: Updated the "wing" feature to be more accurate, added a default input.txt and output.txt, and added gravebang comments.
WING - 1.2: Updated the "wing" feature again and fixed gravebang issues.
WING - 1.5: Removed all gotos and added an interface to LibMath.h
WING - 1.5.1: Added a new kind of sentence to rand, documentation, and formatted.
WING - 1.6: Added another type of WING response and fixed another issue.
WING - 1.6.1: Fixed a serious issue in the second WING response.
WING - Semantic(1.6-2.0): Undocumented update. Tested some lexical stuff.

nAI - (3.0): Complete rewrite of WING. Callbacks, singular file IO, a good library of utilities, cleaner code and an efficient body added.
nAI - (3.5): Why the big jump in the version number? I added a lot to aiCore.h. Now people can wire the learning file themselves with comments and multichars.

mantic - (4.0): Added semantic parses, made more efficient.
mantic - (4.2): Added GNU-Like information commands
mantic - (4.3): Added utilities, cleaned setupStrings(), removed variables to make it consume less memory.
mantic - (4.4): Added the infrastructure for cLineOption but forgot to commit.
matic  - (4.5): Added configuration file and cleaned main, resulting in a HUGE mess called mainHelper.
