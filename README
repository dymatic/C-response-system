INTRODUCTION

This is an AI program with a medium level of intelligence. At this point, you must explicitly teach it everything. In this new version, the WING update, it has a user-defined chance to guess what you wanted to tell it and respond. The program has a special feature called Crunch Commands that allow you to do a whole heap of things, from math to simulations.

INSTALLATION
The executable is ready to roll; all you need to do is invoke it from the command line.You have to make sure that it is in its own directory so that Input.txt and Output.txt do not clutter up the directory where you extract it. You can also compile the source to create an executable, but that would create extra work for minimal gain.

NAMING
Mature version numbers will bring a tier identifier, a codename for that particular version. The name is based on a major feature at that revision. For example, WING was the name given to all versions of AI 1, since I added a WING feature to Engine.h in that version.

VERSION
nAI - 3: Completely rewrote the program and its libraries, including the awful crunch library.

FUTURE PLANS
Re-implementation of the crunch library.

MAP
This software comes with a lot of files. Here is a list of what each do.

main.cpp - Main file
bin/Release/nai - Executable file

HEADER/aiCore.h - Utilities relating directly to the talking and learning part of the program.
HEADER/Crunch/crunch.h - Top-level abstractions for crunchLand
HEADER/Crunch/crunchLand.h - Lowest level. Returns the functions relating to crunches.
HEADER/Crunch/voids.h - No-mans-land, basically. Holds big things for crunchLand.
