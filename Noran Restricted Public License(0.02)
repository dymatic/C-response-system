PREAMBLE:

The Noran Restricted Public License was developed for the use on my
software, and serves as an alternative to the viral GPL and the 
overly-flexible BSD license. Anybody is permitted to use the license,
so long as the following terms are met.

NRPL 0.02:
    
  License hacking
  
The distributor of this particular copy of NRPL(0.02), which will
be referred to as "the license", or "NRPL" acknowledges that they
will not edit the text of this license while still claiming that it
is the NRPL; you must speciy that it is a different entity. If you
do edit the license in this way, you must make sure that the project
still meets the requirements found under both "Distributors" and
"Editors". Anybody is permitted to use sections of this license in
their own legal binding agreements, but they are unable to claim that
the text is any revision of the NRPL, regardless of how much of it has
been edited.

  Distributors
  
The accompanying content which this license governs, which will be referred to
as the "product" or "project", is able to be distributed in its entirety for
public, personal, and commercial use.
Selling exact copies of the product is permitted, granted that you make
any consumers aware of the original creator in some external form.
"External" can be a the attached license in either digital or printed
form within the package or physical container in which the product
is located. The source code of the product MUST be made freely
editable and distributed in a decompiled, textual format. 
Accompanying executables may be attached so long as the source
code is distributed alongside it. If the source is not available,
even if the executable is present, it goes against the terms of 
this license; regardless of whether or not the distributor is willing
to relinquish the source code at a later time or in a separate archive
than the executable. To reiterate, the source of the product must be
available in the same archive that contains this license. This does
not require that it be contained in the same directory. When distributing
a product, you cannot claim it is another product by either imitating the
name in such a way to obstruct the other or claiming to be affiliated with
the author company of the other product.

  Editors

Editing the files governed by this license is permitted except for
one exception, and that is this license (See: License hacking).
Editors must give credit to the original creator of the file which
is being edited, or include a centralized credit file that 
describes the contributions of past editors and the author for
commercial distribution of editted files. If the file is being 
publicly distributed but is not intended to generate funds, no 
credit must be given. If an editor besides the author did not leave
a way of identifying themselves within the source or by another 
external mean, their credit is not required. For personal or 
non-commercial use credit is not necessary and the editor may do 
whatever they want with the source that is still allowed by this 
license. If an editor deletes or corrupts the means of determining
who a past editor was, they are the ones in violation of the 
license; the editors beforehand are not offendors.

  Relicensing

The main difference between the GPL and the NRPL is the removal
of the viral properties of the GPL. Any projects containing
exact copies of source code licensed under the NRPL must be
licensed under another open-source license, such as the GNU
General Public License, the BSD license, the MIT license, 
or any other free license. "Exact copies of source code" are
not defined by variable names, format, or any other optional
means, but rather the method used to attain the functionality
that is being transfered into the project. "Method" refers to
the number of variables, what constructs are used, or a method
that is an obvious "snippet" of NRPL-licensed code. The strategy
of analyzing the assembly produced by the compiler is not to be
 trusted for determining whether or not code is used from an NRPL 
product. If the project meets the above qualifications, it can be
relicensed, at which point it is no longer governed by the NRPL,
but rather the license chosen to replace it. To move from another
license into the NRPL, the project must meet the requirements in
this license mentioned in "Distributors" and "Editors". License
shifting must also be legal under the definition of the license
that the product is currently governed by.
